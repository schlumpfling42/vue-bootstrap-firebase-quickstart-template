# What is a webapp and how do I use it
A web app is a computer program that performs a specific function by using a web browser, such Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox or Microsoft Edge, as its client. \
For instance Google Search is a program that will search information on the internet. \
How do you use it? To start a webapp in your browser you need to enter an address, or URL, so the browser can look it up and load it. To use Google Search the address, or URL, is http://www.google.com.  \
After you enter the URL the browser will contact a server called a DNS server to find out where that web app can be found. It's similar to something like a phonebook or yellow pages for web sites or web apps. The DNS server will tell the browser the address, called IP address, of the server that hosts the webapp. Once the browser has the address, it will contact the server to load the webapp. \
When the browser contacts the server it will return an html page. \
HTML is a so called markup language that contains instructions about how and what information to display in the browser. The browser loads this information and renders a page on the screen. \
The HTML page can also have images or code that can either be contained in the page, or loaded from a separate file on the server. \
The code that is included in the HTML page is Javascript code. The browser can execute the code to react on button clicks, it can dynamically change the information and elements displayed in the screen or send data back to the server. Javascript is a very powerful language and allows to create web sites or apps that are easy to use. \
This project will explain how to create a single page webapp. A single page webapp is an app where the browser, when you enter the url, only loads one single HTML file and the Javascript that is included, will take care of most of what is displayed on the screen. It will look as if you are using several pages, but everything is controlled by the Javascript code.
